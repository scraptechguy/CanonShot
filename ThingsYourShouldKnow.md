Simulator of cannon ball shot. Input two velocities vectors of which are pointing straight vertical and horizontal
x, y; vx0 vector is pointing straight along the x axis and vy0 vector straight along the y axis,
their combination and time updating over the time is resulting the curve,
air resistance is not included (yet, still on it!),
one pixel is equal to one meter in real life, 
velocities are in meters per second
