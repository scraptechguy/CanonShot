Simulator of cannon ball shot. Input two vector velocities, then enjoy!
x, y; vx0 vector is pointing straight along the x axis and vy0 vector straight along the y axis,
their combination and time updating over time is resulting the curve,
one pixel is equal to one meter in real life, velocities are in meters per second
