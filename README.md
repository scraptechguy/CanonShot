# Things you should know

Simulator of flight of cannonball shot. Input two velocities vectors of which are pointing straight vertical and horizontal x, y; vx0 vector is pointing straight along the x-axis and vy0 vector straight along the y-axis. The combination of two and time updating overtime is resulting in a pretty accurate trajectory estimate.

Small red squares represent the movement of the cannonball on a certain axis. 
Air resistance is not included (yet, still on it!), one pixel is equal to one meter in real life, velocities are in meters per second.

Program should run after pasting to any code editor (i.e. VS Code, Sublime text, etc.) with Python 3 installed on your computer. Formating issues may appear when pasting directly to a terminal.
