# Things you should know

Simulator of cannon ball shot. Input two velocities vectors of which are pointing straight vertical and horizontal
x, y; vx0 vector is pointing straight along the x axis and vy0 vector straight along the y axis,
their combination and time updating over the time is resulting the curve,
air resistance is not included (yet, still on it!),
one pixel is equal to one meter in real life, 
velocities are in meters per second

program should run without any problems after pasting to any code editor (i.e. VS Code, Sublime text, etc.) with Python 3 installed on your computer

formating issues may appear when pasting directly to terminal
